---++ Description

The plugin allows you to cut out a specific text section for a specific wiki group. 
By passing a name or name list of wiki groups to the plugin you can define those view rights 
for this section.

---++ Usage

To define view rights for a section simple surround a section of any size with the following 
start and stop tag:

<verbatim>
%STARTPERMISSION{...}%
  ...any section...
        ...of any size...
%STOPPERMISSION%
</verbatim>


Supported parameters:

| *Parameter:* | *Value:* | *Description:* |
| allow | Group name %BR% or list of group names (comma separated) | Only (!) that group or grouplist *can* view the section |
| deny | Group name %BR% or list of group names (comma separated) | That group or group list *cannot* view the section |

You need to define either deny or allow! Both do not work together and will cause no operation.

__Note:__ The admin group will never be affected.

---++ Examples

Only the admin group can see the following section:

%STARTPERMISSION{allow="AdminGroup"}%
Foswiki makes my day.
%STOPPERMISSION%

Guess it! :-)
